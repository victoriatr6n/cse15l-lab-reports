#cd
1. An example of using this command with no arguments is:
```
{
  [user@sahara ~]$ cd
  [user@sahara ~]$ pwd
  /home
}
```

The working directory was /home when the command was run. 
Because the command line had no arguments, just cd command, the default was to change the directory to the home directory. 
When there are no arguments, that means that we have not specified which directory we want to change to.
